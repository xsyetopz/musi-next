# SEAM Domains

Status: proposed

This spec defines the final public SEAM domain contract.

Domain names are fixed:

- `managed`
- `resumable`
- `native`
- `link`
- `introspect`

These are VM and module-contract concepts. They are not source-language feature names.

## Rust Comparison

Rust 2024 is the host language for the current VM and compiler. SEAM domains may map to Rust modules, types, traits, or unsafe boundaries internally.

That host structure is not the SEAM contract. Public SEAM names stay domain names such as `managed`, `resumable`, `native`, `link`, and `introspect`. Do not expose Rust trait/module names as SEAM feature ids.

## `managed`

`managed` defines movable managed heap semantics and verifier-tracked non-owning views.

Public features:

- `managed.core`
- `managed.layout`
- `managed.views`
- `managed.weak`
- `managed.rtti`

Standardized heap and value kinds:

- `string`
- `bytes`
- `array`
- `object`
- `closure`
- `continuation`
- `weakref`
- ephemeral `ref`
- ephemeral `mutref`
- ephemeral `slice`

Rules:

- heap objects may move
- stable managed addresses do not exist outside native pin regions
- `ref`, `mutref`, and `slice` are non-null and non-owning
- `mutref` is exclusive
- `ref`, `mutref`, and `slice` may not be stored in heap, globals, exports, closures, or returns
- maps, sets, tagged sums, tuples, ropes, and similar structures lower to these primitives instead of becoming VM-native heap kinds
- finalizers and destructor semantics are not part of `managed`

Relation to Musi specs:

- `Array[T]`, `Ref[T]`, `MutRef[T]`, and `Slice[T]` lower against this domain
- movable managed heap must remain consistent with `specs/runtime/memory-model.md`

## `resumable`

`resumable` defines driver-owned resumable control.

Public features:

- `resumable.handlers`
- `resumable.cont.oneshot`
- `resumable.unwind`

Rules:

- control frames are first-class runtime state
- portable bytecode names the runtime frame a control frame
- continuation capture is one-shot
- resumed continuation may not resume again
- stack restoration and control-frame restoration are standardized runtime behavior
- multi-shot continuations are not part of this domain
- generators, coroutine schedulers, and async task systems are not part of this domain

This domain is named for runtime behavior, not source syntax. Host behavior enters SEAM through native calls and module loading.

## `native`

`native` defines host and ABI interop.

Public features:

- `native.abi.c`
- `native.abi.registry`
- `native.ptr`
- `native.pin`
- `native.cstr`
- `native.cptr`

Rules:

- `Ptr[T]` is typed raw pointer capability
- `CString` and `CPtr` remain boundary mapping concepts
- ABI registry allows named ABIs beyond C
- nullability is explicit
- raw managed address extraction needs active pin scope
- C-style pointer arithmetic is not part of this domain
- ambient host powers are not part of this domain
- foreign ABI calls use `call.ffi`; `nat` is not a SEAM mnemonic root

Relation to Musi specs:

- `Ptr[T]`, `CString`, `CPtr`, and `unsafe` lower against this domain
- this domain must remain consistent with `specs/runtime/interop.md` and `specs/interop/c-interop-memory.md`

## `link`

`link` defines import, export, capability, and module-loading contracts.

Public features:

- `link.imports`
- `link.exports`
- `link.capabilities`
- `link.dynamic`

Rules:

- static imports and exports are standardized
- capability imports are explicit and verified
- dynamic loading and lookup are domain features, not ambient VM behavior
- source-language module semantics are not part of this domain
- dynamic module bytecode uses `mdl.load` and `mdl.get`; `mod` is not a SEAM mnemonic root because it conflicts with mathematical modulus

This domain exists so runtime linking is a declared contract instead of a side effect of the host.

## `introspect`

`introspect` defines public metadata and public reflection.

Public features:

- `introspect.types`
- `introspect.members`
- `introspect.attrs`
- `introspect.layout`
- `introspect.invoke`
- `introspect.access`
- `introspect.construct`

Rules:

- reflection is full for public and exported contract only
- reflection may inspect metadata, invoke public members, access public members, and construct public values
- private or internal details are outside portable SEAM reflection contract
- source maps, debug names, and tool metadata live in this domain

This domain is wider than `debug`. It covers runtime-introspectable public structure as well as tooling payloads.

## Common Verification Rules

The SEAM verifier enforces:

- required domain presence
- required feature presence
- stack and local discipline
- method and block stack-signature discipline
- non-escaping view restrictions for `managed.views`
- one-shot continuation discipline for `resumable.cont.oneshot`
- pin requirements for `native.pin`
- declared capability and import correctness for `link`
- public/export-only visibility boundaries for `introspect`

## Feature Naming

Feature ids use `domain.feature` naming.

Rules:

- domain segment is reserved
- feature segment is stable and additive where possible
- modules declare required features explicitly
